# Hiking into mysterious Kamokochi 上高地

Late winter is the quietest time in **Kamikōchi 上高地**: no tour buses, just the crunch of snow under micro-spikes and the faint crack of river ice shifting upstream. Our plan was a gentle out-and-back from the seasonal closure gate to Kappa-bashi and on toward Myōjin-ike.

## 1 · Starting from the tunnel gate!  

It is quite safe for people to enter during Feb and March, cause the temperature during this period is very stable and temp here is ok for snow not melting fast.
Except for road, the piled snow is higher than a person.  
Since a lot of outdoorers camp inside and hiking, and also the construction team that doing their job for the soon opening for general tourists, the road bascially have no snow or all flat, very easy to walk!
Snowshoes is not even needed as long as you stays on the track. Be sure not to going to the no-road area!!! It could be very dangerous if you step into a snow tree hole.

## 5 · Return under cloudy skies

We were back at the tunnel gate by 3-4 AM, just before the construction team ending their work and retreat. 
Total distance: **about 25 km** round-trip, **+310 m** elevation gain—gentle by summer standards, magical in winter silence.
